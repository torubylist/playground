package pool

/*
1. Object pool pattern is useful in cases where object initialization is more expensive than
the object maintenance.
2. If there are spikes in demand as opposed to a steady demand, the maintenance overhead
might overweigh the benefits of an object pool.
3. It has positive effects on performance due to objects being initialized beforehand
